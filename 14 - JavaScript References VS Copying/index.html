    let age1 = 100
    let age2 = 200
    console.log(age1, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    console.log('players', players)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Dave' // alters players array

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log('players', players)
    console.log('team', team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = 'Joseph'
    console.log('team2', team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    team3[3] = 'Jim'
    console.log('team3', team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'ES6'
    console.log('team4', team4)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      age: 37,
      name: 'Jim Jones'
    }
    // with Objects
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.name = 'Captain'
    console.log('person', person)
    console.log('captain', captain)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Captain 2'})
    console.log('person', person)
    console.log('captain2', captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
